List at least **four key concepts or skills** you learned during the Git crash course. For each one, write a brief explanation of how it helped you manage your portfolio project more effectively.

- **Merge Conflicts**: Taught me how to resolve merge conflicts in VS Code
- **Pull requests**: Helped me separate features and prevent conflicts when working on different sections of the site.
